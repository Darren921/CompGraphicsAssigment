Readme including all required explanations and supporting documentation. The
explanation must include the following:
â–ª How was the item implemented (what was modified and done differently
from the class and labs to fit the context of your scene?), how does your
scene benefit from the way the item was implemented?


The items implemented were diffuse, ambient, and specular lighting 


For the color grading we added a cool, warm and custom LUT. These three each give us a different look in the game, depending on which one we choose in game. These can be changed in game by toggling between 4,5,6 to give us the different looks. This helped give looks that we thought made the game look more intresting rather in a way we thought was cool.  

For our blending shader we added it to our enemeny object giving him a texture and changing the color to red to make it more scary and ghost like which we thought was cool. We applied the Alpha blending effect which essentially blends two colors in a way that makes is somewhat transparent. This in turn gave a more menacing and ghost like appearence to the demon.
